\chapter[Expected results]{Expected results of the project}
\chlab{expectations}

This research project is expected to deliver the following results:
\begin{itemize}
\item A good design for a tool that assists in fragment-based molecule parameterisation;
\item A working prototype for that tool;
\item A tool that allows for manual parameterisation, with comparable results to parameterisation using quantum calculations;
\item A tool that makes it easier to perform molecule simulations;
\item A tool that chemists like to use;
\item A master's thesis.
\end{itemize}
