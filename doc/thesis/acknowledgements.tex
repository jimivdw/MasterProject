As is the case with any project, this thesis would not have been able to be completed without the help of others. First of all, I would like to thank my project supervisors Mohammed El-Kebir and Gunnar Klau, who had the original idea for this project and helped me out with the chemical concepts, and Tijs van der Storm, who helped to make sure the project stayed interesting from a software engineering perspective.

Second, I would like to thank Daan Geerke and Luigi Capoferri, two chemistry researchers at VU University Amsterdam. Meetings with them have truly been helpful, and helped to improve the chemical correctness of \oframp. Additionally, thanks go out to all who participated in the user studies. I would like to apologise for the long experiment, but the data gathered from that has been very helpful.

I would like to thank my fellow students and colleagues at Centrum Wiskunde \& Informatica~(CWI), whom I could always ask for help or advise. We had some nice lunches and coffee breaks together, and had lots of fun at Praethuys~(end of the month drinks) and the Polder caf\'e.

Last, but not least, many thanks go out to all of my friends and family, who supported me during the whole course of this project. I could always come over for dinner after a long day of studying, or join for some recreational activities. Completing this thesis would have been a lot harder without all the support. Thanks!
