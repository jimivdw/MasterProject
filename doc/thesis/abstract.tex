\abstract{
The current process of calculating atom charges uses complex-quantum mechanical calculations that take a long time to complete. A new approach has been proposes, where unknown atom charges are found using fragments from similar molecules for which the charge is known. This approach has been implemented in \oframp, a system that allows chemists to manually do this charge assignment. Two different interaction designs for it have been made and implemented, and were compared in a user study. It turned out that an interaction design with only minimal automation is the best for the task at hand, as this gave users more control and provided a better overview. Additionally, it was found that this manual process can be completed relatively fast, and, with a few improvements to the fragment matching algorithm, deliver good results.
