Computational chemists frequently use molecular simulations in computer-aided drug design. As input, these simulations require molecules that have been parameterised with atom charges. Typically, these charges are obtained from complex quantum-mechanical calculations, which are only feasible for small molecules. We propose a new approach for molecule parameterisation, which uses matching fragments from a repository of molecules that have already been parameterised. This approach has been implemented in a system called \oframp, for which two different interaction designs have been compared in a user study. We found that a \IDa\ interaction design without automation yields better results than one that continuously makes suggestions to the user. This version is also preferred by the experiment participants, and using it, the parameterisation process can be completed relatively fast. In addition, with a few improvements to the fragment matching algorithm, \oframp\ should produce chemically accurate results.
