In an attempt to speed up the molecule parameterisation process, a new approach has been developed, where the charges of individual atoms in a molecule are retrieved from fragments of other molecules. In order to facilitate this, a system called the Online tool for Fragment-based Molecule Parameterisation~(\oframp) has been developed. Two versions of it, called consuming and producing, have been designed and implemented, and compared using a user study.

From the user studies, it has been concluded that the producing interaction design allowed users to be done quicker, while the consuming version yielded more accurate results. The users showed a strong preference for the consuming design, making this the overall better version of the two. They liked the overview they had of the matching fragments, and felt like they were more in control than in the producing version. This has turned out to be an important aspect, and is required to make a good parameterisation of a molecule.

More in general, most of the commonalities between the two versions were appreciated as well. First, the graphical design of the application was found to be very clean and clear, and noted to look professional. Second, users were enthusiastic about the way in which the molecule was visualised, the ability to move it around and scale it, and the responsiveness of the visualisation. The selection details window was found to be very useful, and the demo mode helped them to quickly learn how to use the system. Finally, although not everyone used it, the help pages were highly appreciated for their extensive descriptions of every aspect of \oframp.

There were, of course, also some negative comments. Often, the found fragments were not ordered such that the actual best match ended up on top of the list. Furthermore, there were situations where barely matching fragments were rated to be very good. Although the development of the fragment finding system was not a part of this project, it needs to be improved further in order for \oframp{} to be able to attain to its full potential.

Additionally, some suggestions have been provided on how the system can be improved further. Spanning from the addition of an auto-select mode for atoms, to the modification of certain atom colours, implementing these suggested changes will further improve the quality of \oframp.

Once all alterations of the system have been made, it is believed that it will become a tool using which a parameterisation can be obtained that is of comparable quality to one obtained using the conventional quantum-mechanical calculations. Furthermore, chemists will be able to fully parameterise a molecule using \oframp{} in less time than using the conventional methods.

It can therefore be concluded that all of the hypotheses posed in \secref{ra_hypotheses} hold. The consuming interaction design presented here turned out to be better than the producing one, and, using \oframp, it should definitely be possible to create molecule parameterisation of equal quality to the calculated ones, in less time.
