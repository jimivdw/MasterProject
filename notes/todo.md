## TODO list
- Update user studies story to reflect the two different implementations;
- Include literature on user studies;
- Check for references to 'the tool' and consider replacing with 'the implementationS';
- Check extended ID section of proposal and integrate it more in the rest of the story;
- Read the whole thing to see if everything is still correct.
