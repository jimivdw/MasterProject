## TODO list
- Implementation:
  - Bugs:
    - Best fit does not work properly with hidden H atoms;
    - Settings thingy is not hidden, can be opened when dragging from the edge of the screen;
    - Right click being recognized by onClick;
    - Aromic cycles still not always correct (see Mohammed's example).
  - Design:
    - Header;
    - Sidebars;
    - Molecule colors (maybe less extreme, e.g. #333 instead of #000).
  - Other:
    - MoleculeViewer should only contain interaction / UX stuff.
- Proposal:
  - Wait for approval.
