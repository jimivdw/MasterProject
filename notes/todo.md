## TODO list
- Implementation:
  - Bugs:
    - None? =)
  - Design:
    - Header;
    - Sidebars;
    - Molecule colors (maybe less extreme, e.g. #333 instead of #000).
  - Implement:
    - Configurable deoverlap limit;
    - Touch events (?).
  - Other:
    - Remove 'interactive' from settings;
    - Hide certain settings;
    - Let MoleculeViewer create its own canvas, rather than passing one;
    - MoleculeViewer should only contain interaction / UX stuff;
    - Do something else with settings (probably copy reference) to prevent things like this.list.molecule.mv.oframp.settings.popup.bg_colors['1'];
    - Refactor getters / setters function names, and maybe some others as well;
    - Canvas drawing is slow on Firefox.
- Proposal:
  - Wait for approval.
