## TODO list
- Check for references to 'the tool' and consider replacing with 'the implementationS';
- Update user studies story to reflect the two different implementations;
- Include literature on user studies;
- Check extended ID section of proposal and integrate it more in the rest of the story;
- Include (dis)advantages of both IDs;
- Read the whole thing to see if everything is still correct.
