# Meeting notes September 13, 2013

### Sequence of application
1. Blank molecule viewer;
2. Input molecule:
    - SMILES string (initial default);
    - InChi string;
    - Other ways, but NOT drawing.
3. Visualize molecule;
4. Retrieve similar sections;
5. User selects best matches;
6. User manually fine-tunes values;
7. User hits save, or whatever.. (Good point for next meeting!)

### Appearance
- 2D shematical view;
    - Gives a better overview;
    - 3D atom positions are not used by the related-sections system anyways.
- Molecules can vary from small (10 atoms) to quite big (500+ atoms);
    - Requires zoom / pan functionality.

### Matching
- Related sections algorithm will be provided by Gunnar and Mohammed;
    - Just takes molecules as input;
    - Outputs (as big as possible) comparable sections.
- System around the algorithm to be designed/decided by me;
    - Web service;
    - Integrated in my system;
    - Something else...

### General
- Mohammed works every day except Wednesday.
    - Is at VU then.
