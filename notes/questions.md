## Questions:
- What happens when the user is done?
- What is the status of the matching program/algorithm?
- How many people would be available for user studies?
  - Would it be possible to test it on students?
  - How to contact them?
- Is there a different way to visualise molecules (other than structural formulas)?
- If not, does it make sense to:
  - collapse 'branches'?
  - group atoms?
  - split-up a molecule in sections and display one at a time?
- Any other developments I need to be aware of?
